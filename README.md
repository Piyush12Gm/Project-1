# Project-1
❤️ Heart Disease Prediction


# Introduction:
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction and diagnosis are crucial to improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. With advancements in data science and machine learning, it's now possible to analyze patient health data and predict the likelihood of heart disease with high accuracy. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is likely to suffer from heart disease based on various health-related features.

By leveraging historical medical data, we aim to assist healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, ultimately supporting better treatment decisions and preventative care.


# Methodology:
We begin by importing and exploring the dataset. The initial steps include data cleaning, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and feature correlations.
After data preprocessing, we split the dataset into training and testing sets and apply several classification algorithms to predict heart disease. Each model is evaluated and compared based on accuracy, R² score, and classification metrics. The best-performing model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen patient data.

# Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- XGBoost Classifier
